/*
 * Team conventions, enforced as Pest architecture tests. The canonical copy
 * lives in the quality-gate skill (~/.claude/skills/quality-gate/arch/);
 * install by copying into an app's tests/Feature/ so it runs on every
 * `php artisan test` - violations go red while the code is being written.
 *
 * On a legacy app, adopt with ignoring() on current offenders and burn the
 * list down over time.
 *
 * Deliberately absent:
 *  - No DB-facade ban: DB::transaction() is sanctioned and toUse() is
 *    class-level, so the exception can't be expressed here. The generation-time
 *    hook and the laravel-conventions-reviewer agent carry that rule instead.
 *  - No Controller-suffix rule: invokable controllers named for their action
 *    (e.g. DownloadRecordPatchScript) are house style.
